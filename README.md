git clone - download the complete repository from github
git add . - to start tracking changes ( dot at the end)
git commit-m "comment" - To commit changes on the GitHub
git push - to push the changes
git pull - to pull the changes

For the first time , we need to get the Personal Authentication token and upload it to access the Gitbut repositiry



# Bash Scripting Agenda
To avoid typing the git add. ; git commit -m ; git push ; - we can write in a single command
